GetHealSize may be called with "nil" as the target in the case of a "Party" heal.  Check that it's non-nil before checking the buffs on target.  This should fix an error in detecting the Grace buff when Prayer of Healing is cast.

Reorganize code slightly for less copy-and-paste duplication.  We now set three variables that are tuned within each spell-specific section:

- baseHealSize is the base heal amount of the spell
- nBonus is the bonus healing effect for the spell
- effectiveHealBuff is the increase to total (effective) healing of the spell.

Each of these variables may be modified by talents, buffs and equipped relics.  These variables are used in the final global formula to determine the heal estimate:

  effectiveHeal = effectiveHealBuff * (baseHealSize + nBonus)

This makes it easier to see how each talent, buff or relic affects the heal estimate.

Paladin fixes:
- Create spell-specific tables of librams.
- Add WotLK librarms.
- Glyphed Seal of Light increases effective healing by 5%.
- Simplify the bookkeeping of factors that buff effective healing by wrapping it all up into a single factor "effectiveHealBuff".
- The librams all increase the spellpower of their respective spells, so make the calculation of the healing bonus more transparent and fix the Holy Light bonus calculation.
